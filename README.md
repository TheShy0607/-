The development of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites has become a crucial and essential component with the advancement of digi
talization. However, LEO satellites also face various security challenges within their networks, and the failure of certain satellites
 may trigger cascading failures. To gain a deeper understanding of cascading failure process in LEO satellite networks and enhance
 its robustness, this letter proposes a novel satellite network model by combining complex network and hypernetworks theories. By
 altering the network structure and model parameters, the robustness performance of the LEO satellite network under three types of
 attacks and two different load distribution methods is thoroughly investigated. The results indicate that satellite networks with vary
ing structures are distinct and exhibit different robustness characteristics under specific attack types. Furthermore, the robustness of
 satellite networks in multiple attack scenarios can be significantly enhanced by implementing improved load allocation strategies.
 These findings not only provide a theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of satellite networks but also ignite new
 perspectives and ideas for future research on their robustness
